// Build a function called keysMatch() which will be given two objects and an array of strings.

// It will use the strings to look up the key-value pair in each object and compare the values. If all the values are explicitly equal to each other, return true, otherwise return false.

// We can start with the following function definition:

const keysMatch = function(obj1, obj2, keys) {

};
