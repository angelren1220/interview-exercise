// This and following questions will now be about writing logic using (pseudo) JavaScript on the "whiteboard".

// My friend Lee is a fan of foosball (insert/use another 1-on-1 game here). Lee plays in an amateur foosball league, has asked us for help writing a program to understand player rankings.

// We're given some game outcome data like the following:

// [
//   { winner: 'Alice', loser: 'Bob',   loser_points: 3 },
//   { winner: 'Carol', loser: 'Dean',  loser_points: 1 },
//   { winner: 'Elise', loser: 'Bob',   loser_points: 2 },
//   { winner: 'Elise', loser: 'Carol', loser_points: 4 },
//   { winner: 'Alice', loser: 'Carol', loser_points: 2 },
//   { winner: 'Carol', loser: 'Dean',  loser_points: 3 },
//   { winner: 'Dean',  loser: 'Elise', loser_points: 2 },
// ]
// Write a function that returns a list of all the player names (no player should be listed more than once).

// ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'Dean', 'Elise']
